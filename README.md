# TicTacToe


First python creation

This was created during my completion of a python course I found online. It is a simple 2 player TicTacToe game using only QWERTY characters as the UI.



This project taught me:

- Basic python syntax
- Control flow using loops
- Incorporating python functions together to act as a script (similar to point 2)
- Taught me how to Google questions I don't know (MOST IMPORTANT BY FAR)
